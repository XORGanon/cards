# XORG "cards" data repository

This is a flat repository for our "cards" used as a database by the renderer at https://mborn.eu/xorg/

### To edit
To edit, add and expand new or existing "cards" open for editing the [cards](https://github.com/XORGanon/cards/edit/main/cards) file, do what you desire, and commit your changes when you're done. While doing so, mind these few but vital **syntax conventions** to keep the renderer working:

* Prefix the title with `#` + `space`
* Prefix property entries with `+` + `space`
* Divide property names and values with `space` + `:` + `space`
* Make one empty line between each "card" and the next

##### Like so
    # Schismogenesis
    + Description : The way in which neighboring entities individuate in a highlighting of their differences.
    + Suite : Belonging
    
    # Semioverse miner
    + Lore : Some metaverse miners call their collectively constructed underworld "The megadungeon": a branching expanding labyrinth, underneath the facadic surface of "reality".
