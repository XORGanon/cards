# XORG "cards" data repository

This is a flat repository for our "cards" used as a database by the renderer at https://mborn.eu/xorg/

### To edit
To edit, add or expand new or existing "cards," open the [cards](https://github.com/XORGanon/cards/edit/main/cards) file for editing, do what you desire, and commit your changes when you're done. While doing so, please mind these few but vital _syntax conventions_ to keep the renderer working:

* Prefix the title with `#` + `space`
* Prefix property entries with `+` + `space`
* Divide property names and values with `space` + `:` + `space`
* Keep one empty line between each "card" and the next
